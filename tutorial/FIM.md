# FIM

The [FIM library](https://github.com/FIM4Science/FIM) is used to easily train and evaluate deep neural networks using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).
Instead of coding models and training routines it suffices to write a simple .yaml file, allowing for quick
and simple experimentation to solve complex problems.

In particular this library stems from the "Foundation Models for Inference" series of papers. The trained models of those are published on
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/FIM4Science) and will also be introduced in the following sections of this tutorial.
